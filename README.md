# Freenove  Big_Hexa_POD STM32F407

The project is to replace the Raspberry Pi with a STM32 MCU and PIXY2 camera. 

I have chosen the development board DevEBox STM32F4VE aka blackboard. https://stm32-base.org/boards/STM32F407VET6-STM32-F4VE-V2.0.html

Benifits of this board
  
    1) Cheap
    2) Lots of GPIO
    3) Fast MCU
    4) SD Card and Flash already built on the board
    5) nRF24L already pinned out
        
# Goals 
    
  1) Remove the power hungry Raspberry Pi.
  2) Replace with much lower powered and cheaper MCU and less chance of coruption if power lost.
  3) Combine the battery compartments to been one power source.
  4) Replace Pi camera with PIXY2 https://pixycam.com/pixy2/
  
# Reason for project, why not.
